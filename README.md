# django-marketplace

*Trying something different than Node.js, Next.js, and React.js.*



I am currently learning Django with Tailwind CSS and have developed a mini marketplace for artisans in the handloom industry. This project was proposed by the Ministry of Culture India for Smart India Hackathon 2021.



Implemented Features:



- User role-based registration, login, and logout with OAuth 2.0.

- Browse products by category, location, username, and price range.

- Update and delete products and user profiles.

- Implemented a secure messaging mechanism for users. If they find a product they're interested in purchasing, they can directly contact the seller to make a deal in the inbox.

Will be working on:

- OTP-based validation.

- Recommendation system for users with different preferences.

- Message notifications.

- Smart AI assistant for customer-related queries and issues.

- Product gallery.

- Follower and following mechanism.



During the development of this application, I learned about Django's default template rendering engine (MVT), creating models for products, users, and categories, as well as understanding how frontend connects to the backend and the database in Django. I referred to YouTube tutorials for guidance.
